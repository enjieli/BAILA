# BAILA
This project is created as a data repository for the manuscript, "An urban biodiversity assessment framework that combines an urban habitat classification scheme and citizen science data" (doi: 10.3389/fevo.2019.00277). It contains the data and R script needed to perform a hierarchical urban habitat classification. 


## Prerequisites
The analysis is written in R. Detailed instruction on how to 
install R can be found here: https://www.r-project.org.


## Running the analysis
Data: data used in our analysis is storeda as ../generated_data/clean_baila_data.rda.This can be used as sample data for other users who are interested in learning how to preform hierarchical urban habitat classification.
R code: R script to conduct hierarchical urban habitat classification can be found at: ../code/hierarchical_clustering.r. 

## Note
Please see manuscript "An urban biodiversity assessment framework that combines an urban habitat classification scheme and citizen science data" (doi: 10.3389/fevo.2019.00277) for more information and background.
